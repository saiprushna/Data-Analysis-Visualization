# Data-Analysis-Visualization
Laptop Data Analysis — Python + Interactive Dashboards Analyze 3,976 laptops across brands, CPU/GPU, RAM, storage, screen resolution, and OS. Includes a clean EDA notebook and a modern, responsive web dashboard (Plotly + Chart.js) with animated visuals.
project exploring 3,976 laptops to uncover trends across brands, CPU/GPU, RAM, storage (SSD/HDD), screen resolutions, and operating systems. It includes a clean EDA pipeline in a Jupyter notebook (data cleaning, feature extraction, insightful summaries) and two modern, animated web dashboards (Plotly and Chart.js) with a responsive neon UI and a lightweight 3D “bubbles” background. You can optionally export notebook aggregates to power the dashboards via data.json.
Key features:
Preprocessing: RAM normalization, resolution parsing, SSD/HDD split, PPI proxy
EDA: brand counts, averages, top CPU/GPU/OS, correlation heatmap
Dashboards: Plotly (web/index.html) and Chart.js (web/chartjs.html) with smooth animations
Responsive, mobile‑friendly UI with gradients, glow, and subtle motion
Optional data export from notebook to web/data.json for live charts
